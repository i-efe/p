create what you want when you want it. 
we are carriers to produce supernaturally what we need when we need it.
your spirit produces and your hands gathers it. 
the kingdom of God is in you and it can produce an economic stimulus package for you and your community. it is powerful enough. 
Favor is when God is leaning in your direction.
